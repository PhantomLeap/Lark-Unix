#Welcome to LARK
#>>>>>>>the Linux Activity to Reinforce Knowledge
#Name of game: [eehh name goes here]
#Developed by: Joyselle Sarmiento, Spencer DePriester
#Narrative: You have woken up in a completely unfamiliar place with no memories of how you got here. It seems to be a normal bedroom, but a bedroom you have no #recollection of. The door leading outside the bedroom is locked, leaving you to try and discover how to escape this room and what else lies beyond that door. You also #know that you’re not alone here, your new companion will help guide you through the rooms and puzzles that wait for you… but maybe he knows more than he’s letting on?
#Instructions: Using linux commands, search through various rooms in an attempt to escape this strange house you’ve been trapped in. Once you’re ready to start the game, #use the command cd room1 and then run the ./intro.sh file.
